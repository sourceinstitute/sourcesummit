        <p>Source Summits are an open conference where you set the topics based on your challenges.  Over 95% of Source Summit participants leave with actionable insight that they apply within a week or less, and most make long-lasting connections to collaborators and advisors.

        <p>We start the day by setting the schedule together. The rest of the day is parallel tracks of short sessions. You'll have the choice of 12 to 18 interactive topics throughout the day.  You’ll meet people engaged in a range of related fields — all sharing their experience in the name of progressing the state-of-the-art.
