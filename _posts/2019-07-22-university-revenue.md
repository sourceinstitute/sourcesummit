## How are different Bulgarian university departments finding new sources of income and students?

Gather with other university professors to share ways to generate income:

- Success stories for attracting students
- Alternative revenue sources, such as projects, spin-outs, and commercialisation - from Bulgarian professors
- Tips for more effectively getting grants
- Knowledge-sharing on EU projects, perspectives from successful bidders and evaluators in Brussels
- Starting local NGOs to create flexibility from university policy
- More! Everyone is encouraged to share their challenges and experiences.

Source Summit is a facilitated, multi-track conference environment.  The schedule is set by the participants at the start, and each session is a facilitated to maximise the applicable results.
