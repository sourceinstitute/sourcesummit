## Scitech in high-growth markets 

A unique day bringing together engineers, entrepreneurs and innovators who are bringing hard science technologies to a range of global markets.

Bringing Scitech to market means working within fast-changing markets, regulatory circumstances, and adapting physical technologies quickly. Source Summit keeps the focus on the actionable, with sessions based on practical, recent lessons learned.  You'll learn directly from real experience, and have plenty of opportunities to get help with your current challenges.

We're running this Source Summit in parallel with the Royal Academy of Engineering's Leaders of Innovation Fellowship. It's designed help those at the front of cutting edge technology and innovation to develop their entrepreneurial ability and commercialise their research. Our October unconference features fellows from across South America.

The two days of the unconference will be 19th and 25th of October.

The programme further includes a number of networking and social events, including concluding the day on the 19th with social drinks at the Tobacco Dock bar from 6pm.
