## How can you use your time at university for entrepreneurial venturing?

Starthub is *the* location to discover about entrepreneurship, get started on your project, and create venturing momentum. On this Source Summit we'll gather different experiences from people that are running ventures, and making revenue, to students involved in the Mastertrack Entrepreneurship, working on entrepreneurial projects, to PhD grads who've landed funding and a mandate with their chair group to build a business. 

On this day we'll be sharing experiences based on:

- Success stories for starting up
- Building your business during, and after studies.
- Finding co-founders, building your team
- Personal development, mental health, and the challenges of being entrepreneur.
- More! Everyone is encouraged to share their challenges and experiences.

Source Summit is a facilitated, multi-track conference environment.  The schedule is set by the participants at the start, and each session is a facilitated to maximise the applicable results.
