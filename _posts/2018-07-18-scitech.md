## Scitech in high-growth markets

A unique day bringing together engineers, entrepreneurs and innovators who are bringing hard science technologies to a range of global markets.

Bringing Scitech to market means working within fast-changing markets, regulatory circumstances, and adapting physical technologies quickly. Source Summit keeps the focus on the actionable, with sessions based on practical, recent lessons learned. You’ll learn directly from real experience, and have plenty of opportunities to get help with your current challenges.

We’re running this Source Summit in within the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Leaders of Innovation Fellowship. It’s designed help those at the front of cutting edge technology and innovation to develop their entrepreneurial ability and commercialise their research. The curent event in Brazil is focused on the Latin American alumni from the previous 4 years of the LIF programme and the guests from the Fronteers of Development symposium.
