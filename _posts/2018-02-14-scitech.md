## Scitech in high-growth markets

A unique day bringing together engineers, entrepreneurs and innovators who are bringing hard science technologies to a range of global markets.

Bringing Scitech to market means working within fast-changing markets, regulatory circumstances, and adapting physical technologies quickly. Source Summit keeps the focus on the actionable, with sessions based on practical, recent lessons learned.  You'll learn directly from real experience, and have plenty of opportunities to get help with your current challenges.

We’re running this Source Summit within the Royal Academy of Engineering’s Leaders of Innovation Fellowship programme. It’s designed to help those at the front of cutting edge technology and innovation to develop their entrepreneurial ability and commercialise their research. Our February unconference features fellows from South Africa, Kenya and Turkey.

The unconference will be 14th of February.

The programme further includes a number of networking and social events, including concluding the day on the 14th with social drinks at the The Hoxton Hotel in Shoreditch from 6pm and an edition of the London Lean Startup Circle on the 8th.


If you’d like to participate in just those please contact [niki@source.institute](mailto:niki@source.institute).
